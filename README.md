# E-Commerce-Backend
The back end for an e-commerce site, powered by Express.js, MySQL, and Sequelize

## Description

The E-Commerce Backend project contains all the backend services you may need to operate a full-stack application. This backend allows you to store information in three tables labeled Categories, Products, and Tags. The application is powered by the Sequelize and MySQL node packages and allows you to interact with the SQL server through the various routes. 

For each table, there are two routes to get either all entries from the table or an entry with a specified id. There are also routes to create new entries in the table, update an entry with a specific id, or delete an entry with a specific id. Using a program like Insomnia or Postman, you can easily test these api calls and utilize them to the needs of your application.

## <a id='install'>Installation</a>

This application requires node.js and therefore, you must install it before you can use the application. If you haven't installed node.js, use the following link [https://nodejs.org/en/download] and install the proper version according to your OS. Once installed, run the node setup executable. Once node.js is setup on your system, go to the directory where you plan to download the repository and run the command `npm init -y` in your terminal. Then download the repository into your desired directory and run `npm i` in the terminal to download all necessary dependencies.

## <a id='usage'>Usage</a>

To use the application, navigate to your directory with the app and just run `node server` in your terminal. From there you can use a program like Insomnia or Postman to make api calls to the live. Check out the walkthrough video at the bottom of the Description section for more help.
